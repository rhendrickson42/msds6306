Live Session Unit 05 - Tidy Data

Backstory: Your client is expecting a baby soon. However, he is not sure what to name the child. Being out of the loop, he hires you to help him figure out recently popular names. He provides for you raw data in order to help you make a decision.

1. Data Munging: Utilize yob2016.txt for this question. This file is a series of popular children's names born in the year 2016 in the United States. It consists of three columns with a first name, a gender, and the amount of children given that name. However, the data is raw and will need cleaning to make it tidy and usable.

2. Data Merging: Utilize yob2015.txt for this question. This file is similar to yob2016, but contains names, gender, and total children given that name for the year 2015.

3. Data Summary: Utilize your data frame object final for this part.
